# Barstool Sports Engineering Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Overview

**tl;dr** - Take this: http://private-227b9-jsonapifizzbuzz.apiary-mock.com/messages, make a page that looks like this: http://bit.ly/2lVgSru.

## How to use
* clone the repo
* cd into the new repo and run `npm install && npm start`

I made the messages have a blue background when unread so that you can tell which ones you've read. I used MobX and React Router as requested. And I threw in a few tests, but probably not all due to timing.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.
